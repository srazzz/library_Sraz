                                        The idea to create IIITs in Andhra Pradesh came in April 2007, at the request of the
                                        Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. He was dissatisfied with the opportunities
                                        available to the rural youth and wanted to set up at least three IIITs in the three
                                        regions of Andhra Pradesh which would ensure better opportunities for rural
                                        students.

                                        A Task Force was created under the Chairmanship of Prof. K.C. Reddy. This Task Force
                                        produced a report to the government recommending the structure and functioning of
                                        the proposed institutions.

                                        In March of 2008, the AP Government created RGUKT by an act of the Legislature as a
                                        full-fledged university which would initially admit roughly the top 1% of the rural
                                        students into the three residential campuses.

                                        The first batch of about 6,500 tenth className graduates was admitted into a six year
                                        integrated program in August of 2008. The initial selection was based on the local
                                        best model where students receiving the top marks in every subject were selected.

                                    <h1>RGUKT Educational Objectives</h1>
                                    <div className="about-text">
                                        The primary objective of establishing RGUKT was to provide high quality educational
                                        opportunities for the aimed rural youth of Andhra Pradesh. The initial goal was that
                                        at least the top 1 % of the rural graduates would be given the opportunity to study
                                        at RGUKT.

                                        The top 1% of rural graduates is around 6,000 to 7,000 per year. Thus, the three
                                        campuses would need residential accommodation for about 36,000 students for the six
                                        year integrated program.

                                        At present, most universities in India and in Andhra Pradesh follow the affiliated
                                        college structure model where the main role of the university is to set the
                                        curriculum and conduct examinations to ensure that the students have indeed learned
                                        the material prescribed in the curriculum. Most colleges have an entering className of
                                        100-300. Having an entry className of 6,000 students leads to issues of scale. This is
                                        unique to RGUKT and is being attempted for the first time in India. In the US,
                                        several of the larger universities do have enrolments of 20,000 to 30,000. However
                                        not all of them tend to be residential universities. Thus RGUKT, as a green field
                                        university, represents a unique experiment in the educational arena.

                                        The assumption is that ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), will permit
                                        the scaling of the learning environments by one to two orders of magnitude is
                                        currently possible.

                                        Another key educational objective of RGUKT is to use advances in learning sciences
                                        and explore the use of modern cognitive science tools in education and learning.

                                        Phrases such as "Learning by Example", "Learning by Doing", "Problem-Based
                                        Learning", "Self-Paced Learning", etc become facilitated when every student can be
                                        assured to have a personal computer that does not have to be shared with anyone
                                        else.

                                    <h1>WHY RGUKT?</h1>
                                    <div className="about-text">
                                        A person born into a low income, rural family in India can't really aspire to study
                                        at an IIIT or aim to be selected into the IAS. This is true is many cases. The
                                        reason for this is because they start with many inherent disadvantages such as:

                                        The educational level of the parents
                                        The quality of teachers and the schools they go to
                                        The ability to pay for coaching classNamees, and
                                        The time on task devoted to study the material
                                        It has been observed that, on an average, the marks obtained by the students in
                                        rural India are about 10-20% lower than the marks of students studying in private
                                        schools of urban India. As a result, most of the seats for higher education get
                                        filled by students from these private schools when the basis of selection is the
                                        marks obtained. Even if a rural student is capable, the educational system doesn't
                                        allow him to go ahead. The goal of RGUKT is to help remedy this unfortunate
                                        situation.

                                        At RGUKT, a a “Lowest Best Model” is used to select students from a small community
                                        like a Mandal which had a few hundred students graduating each year in comparison to
                                        selecting students based on a state wide or nationwide ranking system based on marks
                                        or entrance tests. Such a practice overcomes the disparity in the selection process
                                        between the urban and rural environments. Therefore, the better performance of
                                        students in an urban Mandal doesn't have an impact on the selection process of
                                        students in a neighboring rural Mandal.

                                        The other issue RGUKT is attempting to tackle is the issue of "Early
                                        Specialization". In most cases, once a student goes into a Junior College for a
                                        pre-university program, he gets routed through coaching factories that drill them to
                                        get the top ranks in entrance tests which will enable him to secure a seat in a good
                                        college or university. This kind of intensive coaching makes students
                                        uni-dimensional with very little understanding of anything other than what they have
                                        been coached in.

                                        Once students get into professionals colleges, they don't get any exposure to
                                        Humanities and Social Sciences for the rest of their lives. RGUKT attempts to deal
                                        with this issue by giving students direct admission into a 6-year integrated program
                                        after className X. Here, they are not subjected to two years of torture preparing for
                                        entrance tests. Since these students are already gifted and belong to the top 1%, it
                                        is expected that they will do well naturally and don't need other entrance tests.
                                        However, the reservation system, based on the Affirmative Action Program of India,
                                        requires that students belonging to the weaker sections of society be given at least
                                        50% of all the available seats. Many of these students, due to their backgrounds,
                                        are likely to be less educated and less trained even though they might be the best
                                        in their sub-group. Thus, the student body entering RGUKT will have a diverse
                                        educational level. What is common is that they are selected because they are the
                                        best in that community. Medium of instruction is almost always Telugu. This in turn
                                        brings about the need for remedial programs to be developed so that all students can
                                        go through an educational program with English as the medium of instruction.

                                        In Andhra Pradesh, over a million students pass the className X state wide exam yearly.
                                        Of these, the top 1% or about 10,000 students are probably brilliant but their
                                        educational levels of achievement are diverse and disparate based on their schooling
                                        and quality of education. Since admission into RGUKT is based on a "Local Best
                                        Model" and uses the rule of reservation as put forward by the government of India,
                                        this top 1% has a wide diversity of marks. 60-70% of the students come from rural
                                        backgrounds and will have the opportunity to study in a world className institution.

                                        Education at RGUKT is based on the intensive use of Information Technology. Every
                                        student has access to a laptop and education uses the latest advances in Learning
                                        Sciences such as Learning by Example, Learning by Doing and Problem-based Learning.
                                        Online lectures are provided and lectures are followed by problem solving sessions
                                        that reinforce what has been covered in each lecture.
